Welcome to the Bot cleaner bot- the moderation bot to stop those pesky bots entering your server!

A few notes before you get started with the bot-
     
1) Before using the bot- Please create a MongoDB (atlas) for the bot.   
2) run these commands-   
```
pip install â€”user -r requirements.txt
python3 bot.py
```
3) Update the variables in config.py   

4) Please, import the 2 JSON 's into MongoDB before using too!
 
Our bot is designed to save admins time by banning bots that spread inappropriate links/messages to minors and other members. We have also designed the bot using a point system. We also have included some basic moderation commands for you to use!

I hope you enjoy the bot and if you have any questions~ please message one of our developers/admins-
